# Practical three

This practical decouples the global problem size from the architecture by breaking the processing into chunks (or tiles). This not only means that we are not limited by the L1 buffer space that is available, but furthermore it lays the groundwork for using the compute unit to perform the calculations.

* [The exercise](exercise) contains a walk through of what is required along with the source code that will be used as a starting point
* [Sample solutions](sample_solutions) are provided
