# Exercise One: Sample solutions

In this practical we add pairs of numbers on the data movement RISC-V core.

## Building and running

Details about how to access your account on the RISC-V testbed and set up the environment that we will need for these practicals can be found on the [login and access instructions](https://github.com/RISCVtestbed/tt-tutorial/blob/main/practical/general/RV-testbed.md) page.

Irrespective of the machine you are using, it is assumed that you have a command line terminal in the _tt-tutorial/practical/one/exercise_ directory.

Once you go into this directory, type `make` and run the resulting _ex_one_ executable

```bash
user@login01:~$ make
user@login01:~$ ./ex_one
Completed successfully on the device, with 100 elements
```
