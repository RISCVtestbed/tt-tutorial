# Exercise One

In this practical we are going to look at launching a simple program on the Tenstorrent device and performing some compute on one of the RISC-V baby cores

Learning objectives are:

* To understand how to transfer data to and from the Tenstorrent device
* To illustrate the role of the RISC-V baby cores and how these can access DDR and perform some compute
* To show how the host and Tenstorrent device interact with each other
