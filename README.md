# A practical introduction to Tenstorrent Tensix for HPC

This repository contains the materials for a practical introduction to using Tenstorrent Tensix for HPC. 

This top level directory contains:
* [lectures](lectures) which holds the PDF lecture material, and source powerpoints, for the course, providing an overview to the system architecture and SDK
* [practicals](practicals) contains the practical exercise material along with instructions around how to log into the EPCC RISC-V testbed system and access Tenstorrent hardware

## Tutorial flow

We suggest the following flow for the materials contained in this repository
